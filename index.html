	  <p>Your task is to interpret and act upon the results of a test of positive (implying disease) vs negative (healthy) status.</p>
	  <p>Two bars represent a pos<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">i</span>t<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">i</span>ve test, one bar a negat<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">i</span>ve result. But the result isn't 100% sensitive, so your patient might have the disease even given a negative result. Nor is it completely specific so your patient may be healthy despite getting a positive result.</p>
	  <p>You can diagnose a patient to be healthy by <span style="color:green">swiping right</span>.  Swipe <span style="color:red"> left</span> to indicate you believe the patient has the disease.</p>
	  <p>Either choice you make can be right or wrong. In science mistakes only become apparent after further tests - here you'll get the full impact of mistakes immediately!</p>
